# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 12, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Track user changes with update timestamp using hook. add queue manager for upcoming features. 

**Thoughts:** I had a hard time setting environment again for this project as I was moving to vscode from webstorm. changes was simple but after days they make features.

### Day 2: August 13, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Start android (react-native) app development using ignite. apply for twitter developer account. add native base component and tried to add twitter signing button

**Thoughts:** as I used ignite for another project it was straight forward to make it work, but there was problem with gradle of sign in button and I may need to write or modify some library code tomorrow.

### Day 3: August 14, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Tried 2 libraries for twitter login and there was no luck. I've found another from formidable labs that I'll try tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I need to read more in depth about react native library linking and project structure. I've read ignite documentation but I feel my fundamental knowledge on react native is not enough. I like to try basic things without library then understand what it do when I use it. it can reduce abstraction leak too.

### Day 4: August 15, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Tried appAuth, faced strange error and tried 3 versions of it. I may fallback to auth0

**Thoughts:** I'm not happy that there's nothing to commit. the example of appAuth seems to work (didn't had time to check the twitter oauth). as I go forward I learn more about react native.

### Day 5: August 16, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Added Auth0 and it works, it's somehow a proof of concept but now we have a working twitter authentication. 

**Thoughts:** Today I also flashed an old tablet to test builds on it and make the workflow faster. it was fun and made me happy that there's more memmory for IDE and build server :D. Auth0 documentations and samples are very good and I was up and running with not much hassle. still not sure about this solution and the user experience but going with it for the MVP and complete other parts of app and may update login process later.

### Day 6: August 17, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Added new screen and showing JSON data returned from Auth0

**Thoughts:** I've learned about react navigation and tried to understand it instead of just using. I think it's better for learning and reduce further problems

### Day 7: August 19, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Learned more about Auth0 and Deep linking in android, tried deep linking and add user without using third party and only browser. 

**Thoughts:** I'm a little confused about authentication flow, cause I need to store twitter credentials in the backend while able to login using mobile app. I thought I need a login with twitter button or Auth0. but now I think I may only need to open the backend api in a webview and on the callback redirect a session to app. I'll read and plan for it tomorrow.

### Day 8: August 20, 2018
**Today's Progress**: react-navigation Upgraded and now the app has deep link support that show parameters in the opened screen, also backend redirect to this deep link and send the access token 

**Thoughts:** Today I had a brighter plan and also I knew what to do so I achieved a good progress, also I've get home earlier that usual and finished today's challenge before 10PM, I was tired but had far way better productivity that late night. tomorrow I have a lot to do with access token and making API calls and later I'll go for a deploy and auto app'a APK generating throug CI.

### Day 9: August 21, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Access token generated by server now saves in AsyncStorage and can be used in requests 

**Thoughts:** I've read about `Redux Persist`, `Saga` and `Redux Sause` and installed reactotron that help me in AsyncStorage too. I used redux saga and actions before but I'm a little confused with this reduxsauce thing and I need to learn what problem does it solves and simplify. I know that saving data directly in AsyncStorage is not a good idea for this application but I wanted to have a working version and then improve it by using redux and it's prsist functionality.

### Day 10: August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Save City ID in database using API call and saved Access token 

**Thoughts:** I read about which scenarios I'll need redux, it's a have to or not. and I've come up with that I'll not use it today. and also it was hard to setup redux-form with react native so I switched to formik and it's a good library with good API. It taking more than an hour these days but I learn things here and use 'em in my other projects as well. and I feel very good that I make progress and write them down here

### Day 11: August 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Getting user location and show a toast in case of error 

**Thoughts:** I had a hard time with twitter blockage and get the tablet up and running (vpn bug). it took at least 4 hours and then I go for emulator to get today's task done. I thought that working with location would be hard in react native but it was pretty straight forward, also I had to add a Root component for the toast and I think I'm getting better understanding of HOC in react.

### Day 12: August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Get coordination, convert it to city id and save  

**Thoughts:** still using genymotion instead of real device. I think the basic functionality is working now and I need to go to the UI parts for the app and practice on making an acceptable UI. also I'll need a crash report and some kind of analytics for the app and the backend.

### Day 13: August 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add Logout button, Add application drawer  

**Thoughts:** I didn't know that react-navigation has a built-in drawer. I found out when I couldn't implement native-base's and then in github repository I've found issues about depricating their own drawer and using the react-navigation's instead but the docs didn't updated yet. using react-navgiation drawer was almost smooth and easy, I like the way it integrate with current navigation config. adding the logout button was simple too but the tricky part was that I couldn't set an async storage item to `null`, I had to set it to empty string or remove, I choose to remove it. the code and UI are very dirty at this point but they work.
