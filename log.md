# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 12, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Track user changes with update timestamp using hook. add queue manager for upcoming features. 

**Thoughts:** I had a hard time setting environment again for this project as I was moving to vscode from webstorm. changes was simple but after days they make features.

### Day 2: August 13, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Start android (react-native) app development using ignite. apply for twitter developer account. add native base component and tried to add twitter signing button

**Thoughts:** as I used ignite for another project it was straight forward to make it work, but there was problem with gradle of sign in button and I may need to write or modify some library code tomorrow.

### Day 3: August 14, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Tried 2 libraries for twitter login and there was no luck. I've found another from formidable labs that I'll try tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I need to read more in depth about react native library linking and project structure. I've read ignite documentation but I feel my fundamental knowledge on react native is not enough. I like to try basic things without library then understand what it do when I use it. it can reduce abstraction leak too.
