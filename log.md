# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Track user changes with update timestamp using hook. add queue manager for upcoming features.

**Thoughts:** I had a hard time setting environment again for this project as I was moving to vscode from webstorm. changes was simple but after days they make features.

### Day 2: August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Start android (react-native) app development using ignite. apply for twitter developer account. add native base component and tried to add twitter signing button

**Thoughts:** as I used ignite for another project it was straight forward to make it work, but there was problem with gradle of sign in button and I may need to write or modify some library code tomorrow.

### Day 3: August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried 2 libraries for twitter login and there was no luck. I've found another from formidable labs that I'll try tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I need to read more in depth about react native library linking and project structure. I've read ignite documentation but I feel my fundamental knowledge on react native is not enough. I like to try basic things without library then understand what it do when I use it. it can reduce abstraction leak too.

### Day 4: August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried appAuth, faced strange error and tried 3 versions of it. I may fallback to auth0

**Thoughts:** I'm not happy that there's nothing to commit. the example of appAuth seems to work (didn't had time to check the twitter oauth). as I go forward I learn more about react native.

### Day 5: August 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added Auth0 and it works, it's somehow a proof of concept but now we have a working twitter authentication.

**Thoughts:** Today I also flashed an old tablet to test builds on it and make the workflow faster. it was fun and made me happy that there's more memmory for IDE and build server :D. Auth0 documentations and samples are very good and I was up and running with not much hassle. still not sure about this solution and the user experience but going with it for the MVP and complete other parts of app and may update login process later.

### Day 6: August 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added new screen and showing JSON data returned from Auth0

**Thoughts:** I've learned about react navigation and tried to understand it instead of just using. I think it's better for learning and reduce further problems
**Link to work:** [fooName-mobile](https://github.com/ex7r3me/fooname-mobile)

### Day 7: August 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about Auth0 and Deep linking in android, tried deep linking and add user without using third party and only browser.

**Thoughts:** I'm a little confused about authentication flow, cause I need to store twitter credentials in the backend while able to login using mobile app. I thought I need a login with twitter button or Auth0. but now I think I may only need to open the backend api in a webview and on the callback redirect a session to app. I'll read and plan for it tomorrow.
**Link to work:** [fooName-mobile](https://github.com/ex7r3me/fooname-mobile)

### Day 8: August 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: react-navigation Upgraded and now the app has deep link support that show parameters in the opened screen, also backend redirect to this deep link and send the access token

**Thoughts:** Today I had a brighter plan and also I knew what to do so I achieved a good progress, also I've get home earlier that usual and finished today's challenge before 10PM, I was tired but had far way better productivity that late night. tomorrow I have a lot to do with access token and making API calls and later I'll go for a deploy and auto app'a APK generating throug CI.

### Day 9: August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Access token generated by server now saves in AsyncStorage and can be used in requests

**Thoughts:** I've read about `Redux Persist`, `Saga` and `Redux Sause` and installed reactotron that help me in AsyncStorage too. I used redux saga and actions before but I'm a little confused with this reduxsauce thing and I need to learn what problem does it solves and simplify. I know that saving data directly in AsyncStorage is not a good idea for this application but I wanted to have a working version and then improve it by using redux and it's prsist functionality.

### Day 10: August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Save City ID in database using API call and saved Access token

**Thoughts:** I read about which scenarios I'll need redux, it's a have to or not. and I've come up with that I'll not use it today. and also it was hard to setup redux-form with react native so I switched to formik and it's a good library with good API. It taking more than an hour these days but I learn things here and use 'em in my other projects as well. and I feel very good that I make progress and write them down here

### Day 11: August 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Getting user location and show a toast in case of error

**Thoughts:** I had a hard time with twitter blockage and get the tablet up and running (vpn bug). it took at least 4 hours and then I go for emulator to get today's task done. I thought that working with location would be hard in react native but it was pretty straight forward, also I had to add a Root component for the toast and I think I'm getting better understanding of HOC in react.

### Day 12: August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Get coordination, convert it to city id and save

**Thoughts:** still using genymotion instead of real device. I think the basic functionality is working now and I need to go to the UI parts for the app and practice on making an acceptable UI. also I'll need a crash report and some kind of analytics for the app and the backend.
**Link to work:** [fooName-mobile](https://github.com/ex7r3me/fooname-mobile)

### Day 13: August 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add Logout button, Add application drawer

**Thoughts:** I didn't know that react-navigation has a built-in drawer. I found out when I couldn't implement native-base's and then in github repository I've found issues about depricating their own drawer and using the react-navigation's instead but the docs didn't updated yet. using react-navgiation drawer was almost smooth and easy, I like the way it integrate with current navigation config. adding the logout button was simple too but the tricky part was that I couldn't set an async storage item to `null`, I had to set it to empty string or remove, I choose to remove it. the code and UI are very dirty at this point but they work.
**Link to work:** [fooName-mobile](https://github.com/ex7r3me/fooname-mobile)

### Day 14: August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Header and Drawer improvement, remove Auth0, Change icons to nativebase, link icon assets

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to work on UI, sometimes it's hard for me to just improvise for the UI so I think I need a plan for it. I'm not satisfied with nativebase designs, but it's the best that I can get now. I prefer material design for android but I don't think it's a good idea to use MD in iOS too. react native sometimes throw weird error that I cannot find out why is that without searching.
I'm happy that I've completed two weeks of challenge :D

### Day 15: August 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Login flow with loading screen and prevent to come back to login screen for authenticated user. Add logout button in drawer

**Thoughts:** I'm not generalizing and making component in this project yet, cause I want to prevent overgeneralizing that I'm usually do. first I like to see how things need to be done and then do the optimization. for example I'll get in trouble with signout process, cause there's no API call when it happen from drawer. but I need to see what parts need to be generalized and the add utility files.

### Day 16: August 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create a signed APK from app. create a firebase account and research about it.

**Thoughts:** it wasn't so hard to make an APK, I was made for another project a couple days ago so it was pretty straight forward. but I had to research about finding a database to use for testing app. I think I'll deploy on Zeit's now and using firebase as database

**Link to work:** [fooName-mobile](https://github.com/ex7r3me/fooname-mobile)

### Day 17: August 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: remove native-base and add material ui. convert profile and login page components to material.

**Thoughts:** Yesterday I saw a friend making app with flutter and it was beautiful with material design. I was stick to native base because of a lot of components that it has. also I was added the FAB in another project but the performance and ripple was bad. so I decided to use a lighter but more beautiful material component. using native flex for layout and add other components as needed.

### Day 18: August 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Deploy to now.sh. Fix deep link in app and change links to use new URLs.

**Thoughts:** I was tried now.sh before but I didn't success because of an unused 5MB file in my directory. I removed it and deploy was ok. it took time for me to set secrets, using them as env variables and create an alias for my app. removing unused old deployments is still a pain. when I was testing the app with real authentication I've found out that my deep links are no longer working (that's why we all need to add test!) so I trace it and it was because of the switch navigator that i was added before. it needed to add a `path` property and nest my link one more level to support a drawer nested in a switch. I'm thinking about adding test to this projects

### Day 19: August 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add database for test run in now.sh

**Thoughts:** I think it was more than 3-4 hours to test, debug and find the final solution for testing. if I look it as an investment it's ok but it looks a little to much for non-production. I tried firestone connector for loopback but beside deprecation warnings I couldn't set it up for main database usage. I searched and found mlab free 0.5GB plan. I think it'll work for running tests till I get a server for this project cause running on now.sh and mlab doesn't look efficient for now.

### Day 20: September 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Show current emoji in profile page. save emoji in databse.

**Thoughts:** I didn't know I need a component to show the emoji (it's not supported in all versions), I've found an emoji picker too so I'll add it the next day. I still didn't found short name for all weather emojis but there should be a workaround. also adding a setting page which control auto-update and adding profile picture to drawer are next steps. I think now.sh and mlab are working fine for test purpose.

### Day 21: September 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add OneSignal to project.

**Thoughts:** at start I was confused with build versions in instructions and gradle and other things but when I tried OneSignal that required some changes there I was quite familiar with the environment and just figured it out. also today I've found a new way to give VPN enabled internet to my tablet and now I can test the app and receive notifications on real device, I'm so happy about it.

### Day 22: September 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add Emoji Screen.

**Thoughts:** I thought it would be easy to use an emoji component and hook the selector function but there is problem with layouts in both libraries that I've tried. there are some help-wanted tags in one of them, I choose it so I may able to contribute to that too (it's also better cause it support twitter emojis). also I've learned about export in JS by using it in API URL based on environment

### Day 23: September 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fix emoji screen toolbar, try new layouts.

**Thoughts:** The emoji library has strange layouting that cover toolbar and I can't tap on it. I think I have to read the library to fix this bug.

[fooName-mobile](https://github.com/ex7r3me/fooname-mobile)

### Day 24: September 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Manual emoji selection and save in profile.

**Thoughts:** I searched for a better working emoji selector for react native, but each one had a issue, the first one that I was tested had the twitter pack, a not bad performance, ability to bundle images and I managed to get it works so I think it worth to invest on it and maybe I'll be able to PR to this library and make it better. I was on the edge of giving up for progress and trying to find a better solution on the other day, but as the previous experiences I tried to choose what's working and briging the value, then change it or improve it. and the end user value is more important that the perfect solution.

### Day 25: September 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add close functionality for emoji picker.

**Thoughts:** Most of today's time I was reading the emoji picker library to find the functionalities that I want and to fix some bugs that I'm hitting. the blocking bug for now is that buttons come over the picker. I was thinking if I wouldn't be able to fix it in a reasonable time I'll workaround and hide buttons when picker is showing (I know it's a really bad Idea but that's a last resort to don't block the production and stuck in development phase)

### Day 26: September 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Find some ways that cannot be able to develop react native modules locally.

**Thoughts:** I need to make change in library and I need to be able to develop this module locally, but I get error for compilation, dependency and even simple copy pasting the directory doesn't work. I have to find the correct way or dig more.

### Day 27: September 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made a PR on emoji library. Removed emoji selector screen and put all code in profile screen.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited that I've found this library and if I'll be able to contribute to it. currently the fooName project structure is not in a good shape but it needs to be working, then getting optimized. I may add redux to it. I think I have to share first release soon too. I'm looking for a logo to start with.

### Day 28: September 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Save manually selected emoji. update only flagged users when app runs.

**Thoughts:** today progress was a key feature in the app. I think I'll need to add an auto update setting in the setting screen and showing photo or previous selected emoji's in profile page too. also I'll need a manual name changing too (and maybe bio!). I'm excited that I can change it via app. I also hope I can contribute to the emoji library. it's a nice module.

### Day 29: September 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Save and show user image.

**Thoughts:** Adding some extra field and custom profile build on sign up wasn't that hard, I was familiar with them but I had some issue with lodash dadn't it doesn't recognize `null` as a falsy value in `_.get` and it cause me problem with emoji (it crashes on null value) so I had to cover the null scenario manually. on the other had I assumed that material-ui Avatar component will make my image rounded but it doesn't, it just shows the image and I didn't find any good to use it, so I went with the react-native `Image` component. I may change it to Avatar later but not till I read the source and understand what does it actually do. I think It's time to go for a state management (I think redux, cause I used it before). I'll test it in this project and reuse it in another project soon.

### Day30: September 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add redux and save user profile.

**Thoughts:** My previous attempts on redux in react native was failure, but tonight I've focused on it and found what I have to do. I knew the concpet but the redux-sauce whas (and still is) a strange library. I'm using it because ignite framework using it and I was using a different lib for react in another project. anyway I need to learn how exactly does it simplify the redux process and is there any better alternative or not. I'm happy that now I can go for drawer image and make data and app state more stable and clean. I was waiting for it for so long :))

### Day31: September 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Auth and Profile screens using redux to access data.

**Thoughts:** Reading a lot of related issues to find out what's wrong with dispatching a navigation action from saga and didn't found any useful result so I went with a workaround solution as it wasn't that much important in this case but I think I have to find a better solution for this scenario. I've added redux props to profile screen, howere it's not working well now (the store doesn't update) and there's a logical conflict about saving access token. but the structure is looks better than before.

### Day32: September 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Handle and save state with redux and redux persist

**Thoughts:** More than a day, and now I can use 'em all together. I'm tired than write about it. but I think I can write some medium articles about things that I've learned. it was awesome. and the best part is that I'll practice to implement them again in a product tomorrow.

[fooName-mobile](https://github.com/ex7r3me/fooname-mobile)

### Day33: September 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add test for redux reducers and sagas.

**Thoughts:** After investigating call and put in redux-saga and having the basic functionality in the app, I thought it's time to write some regression test before adding features. I started with saga and reducers as I already have some experience with the storybook, to learn them and somehow know and control the learning curve process. it went good and now I have passing test and code coverage, more importantly I hav a code that I'm sure what it do.

### Day34: September 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Profile screen code cleanup, Add Update user and more test.

**Thoughts:** I'm having fun with redux and sagas tests, it gives me a better understanding of how my application shoud work and put some light on functionalities. Adding a Drawer and using background image was good but as I go forward I feel more need to practice more on my CSS and flex skills. I also found out that it's better to use put instead of call for actions. I like to read more about it.
**Link to work:**
[fooName-mobile](https://github.com/ex7r3me/fooname-mobile)

### Day35: September 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: more profile screen code cleanup, add location redux and saga, location button auto disable.

**Thoughts:** it wasn't easy to embed react native geolocatin in the saga, cause it doesn't look like a promise and a callback only function. after a lot of search it seems that converting it to a promise is the best solution. so I've done it and removed the API component from the profile screen. now it's a lot better.

### Day36: September 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add snackbar for user and user update fetch.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting use to TDD and it gives me better perspective of the project. finding the proper way to integrate snackbar has take a little time from me but it was fun.

### Day37: September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add Icon.

**Thoughts:** trying to get tablet's VPN working to able to access twitter was a 4-5 hour effor which was again unsuccessful. I tried to go with an easy task like changing the icon. I change another project's icon by mistake and it worked. but when I changed it in fooname it wouldn't compile and run and android, I don't think it's a problem with the icons but a problem with the onesignal as the basic troubleshooting shows.

### Day38: September 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Resolve build problem, Add radiobutton.

**Thoughts:** I just followed documents and issues with a fresh mind and the problem solved, about the radio button, I thought that it should be a switch (for a while I'm using iPhone as my daily phone!) but I found out that they are different in android and iOS. I have problem adding text to it cause of formik, It shouldn't be a big problem but it's not straight forward neither.

### Day39: September 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Wrote my first Medium article with sample code repository.

**Thoughts:** It was a long time that I wanted to share what I learn on Medium and also try to repeat solving challenges to learn them better. so I picked one of the recent challenges and wrote about it. it took more than an hour (I think coding part maybe was an hour alone). I'm happy about it, today is a holiday and I may keep doing this on next week too.

### Day40: September 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Create example app for emoji-mart-native.

**Thoughts:** First basic functionalities was easy to create but adding the local-images was a little challenging also I think there's a problem with the current packages and they may be outdated, I'll check it tomorrow and post the PR as soon as it get the neede standards
**Link to work:**
[emoji-mart-native]( https://github.com/ex7r3me/emoji-mart-native)

### Day41: September 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Load emoji from local images. add all emoji sets to emoji-mart-native example app.

**Thoughts:** Yesterday I was working on the sample of the emoji mart in react native and I was forgot to add the other sets as well. I had some failed attempts but tonight I tried again and it went ok. also used these local images in the fooname project.

### Day42: September 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add Modal and all emojis data.

**Thoughts:** It seems there's a problem about emojione license so I think I should open an issue about it, but first I want to get one more step on the example app.
**Link to work:**
[emoji-mart-native]( https://github.com/ex7r3me/emoji-mart-native)

### Day43: September 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add picker and choosing the set.

**Thoughts:** I ignored the emojione after tried direct downloading, I'll open the issue about it. I tried React native picker and it was cool but had some problems with custom field, I bypassed it and put the items manually but it doesn't trigger if the same option that was selected select again (onChangValue). it works for now, I will ask the repo owner for further optimizations.

### Day44: September 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Get app ready for PR and open issues and followups.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy I've finally open this PR, I had some guilty feeling cause it took about 2 week (I had busy schedule about another project and prefer to working on foonameMobile cause it was helping the other project too) the chances that it need updates are high but I'm happy that I could suggest some point to make the project better.

### Day45: September 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Updated the sample app.

**Thoughts:** It was fun updating the app, I wish I could done it tonight but it's too late already and I should review and cleanup with fresh mind. a good thing about making it is that I exercise the features I need in foonameMobile, it's going to be a chain of projects that help each other to get better and i like it.

### Day46: September 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More updates on sample app, update fooname's lib and inline emoji picker.

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure how much I had played a role for the some improvements in the main lib, it wasn't something that I did but I had some effects I think, anyway it makes me feel good about what I'm doing in this challenge and collaborating with someone else is exciting and have things to learn. being more specific, communicate and for example give a time estimate for things that I'm going to do. the fact that recent changes solved some problems in the fooname is very awesome. no longer layout problems (I remember first days I was struggling with this!). I should release the fooname in the next couple of weeks and I have to find a server to host the database and webapp.
