# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 12, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Track user changes with update timestamp using hook. add queue manager for upcoming features. 

**Thoughts:** I had a hard time setting environment again for this project as I was moving to vscode from webstorm. changes was simple but after days they make features.

### Day 1: August 13, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Start android (react-native) app development using ignite. apply for twitter developer account. add native base component and tried to add twitter signing button

**Thoughts:** as I used ignite for another project it was straight forward to make it work, but there was problem with gradle of sign in button and I may need to write or modify some library code tomorrow.
