# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 12, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Track user changes with update timestamp using hook. add queue manager for upcoming features. 

**Thoughts:** I had a hard time setting environment again for this project as I was moving to vscode from webstorm. changes was simple but after days they make features.
