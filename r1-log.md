Tried AppAuth and getting strange errors, I've learned about js server and bundling in react native https://github.com/ex7r3me/fooname-mobile

### R1D5
Integrated Auth0 in application, it was pretty straightforward and fun to work with. it's a proof of concept and in following days i'll work on other parts of the app and backend.

Added deeplink and open in browser linking in react-native. I have to read and learn more about my app architecture but first I wanna have a working version.

##R1D8
I've upgraded react-navigation in the project and add a deep-link support to open a screen and show access token that created by loopback for the user that signed up with Twitter.

##R1D9
Now the app remembers the access token. it saves the access token in AsyncStorage, I need to implement redux but it working for now and I'm happy that I've learned about it.

##R1D10
I've tried redux-form in react native but it was overcomplicated and I may don't want to use redux in this project so I I've found formik and added it. now user can save his/her City ID in database

##R1D11
I've played with react-native geolocation API, it was very smooth and easy. also added native-base's toast to the project. now I get the location and show a toast in case of error. https://github.com/ex7r3me/fooname-mobile

##R1D12
I've added an endpoint to get coordination and convert it to cityId using OpenWeather's API. also app sends lat and long to the this API endpoint. user updates automatically using hooks. https://github.com/ex7r3me/fooname-mobile

##R1D13
I've add the react-navigation's drawer to the app and a logout button to delete token and send logout request to server. react navigations looks like a hero in react-native!  https://github.com/ex7r3me/fooname-mobile

##R1D14
I'm focusing on UI Improvements in the app. Today I've changed screen names in the drawer, change Header's layout (Add hamburger menu), linking icon library and make home screen buttons a little better. also, I've removed some unused libraries.  https://github.com/ex7r3me/fooname-mobile
